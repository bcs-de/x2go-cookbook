x2go Cookbook
=============
This cookbook sets up x2go-servers.

There are two kinds of servers (and therefor at least two recipes):

 1. x2goserver where users can connect to with x2goclient and work remotely.
    The recipe x2go::server aims to do this.
 2. X2Go Thinclient Environment servers providing the infrastructure to boot
    diskless clients from network and start x2goclient.
    The recipe for that is x2go::thinclientenv.

Not that the X2Go discourage running both roles on one server. And we have no
reason to say otherwise.

Requirements
------------

#### operating system
This cookbook is currently developed on Debian 7.1 (wheezy). It should also
work on Ubuntu LTS 12.04 or higher but thats speculation.

Supporting RPM-based distributions is currently not on my roadmap but patches
are accepted.

#### packages
The recipes install what they need.

#### cookbooks
To provide the netboot environment for the thinclients, the
thinclientenv-recipe needs <em>nfs</em>- and <em>tftp</em>-cookbooks.

#### environment
To make your diskless clients boot the X2Go-TCE you have to configure your
dhcp-server to send them to the server with the x2go::thinclientenv recipe.
That step is not (yet) done by the x2go-cookbook.

  ]
}
```

Contributing
------------
This is a public cookbook currently in the stove. So the usual github+opschef
steps apply for now:

1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)
3. Write your change
4. <del>Write tests for your change (if applicable)</del>
5. <del>Run the tests, ensuring they all pass</del> Test your changes:-)
6. Submit a Pull Request using Github
